I. The computer game combines several elements: a static Game Map together with dynamic challenges in special windows, namely the Memory Challenge and the Video Challenge.

The Memory Challenge primarily requires a keen sense of observation. The solution is entered by mouse clicks.

The Video Challenge is a vintage video game, naturally realised using actual technology stuff. Control of the player character is achieved by using the mouse buttons and the scroll wheel.

As a narrative framework, the game draws upon the legend of King Arthur, combined with elements of medieval knighthood. Within the game, the player progresses through the stages leading to knighthood: Page, Squire, and Knight.

As a crowning finale, particularly skilful players may succeed in conquering the crown for Arthur. At this point, the ultimate goal of the game is achieved: Arthur not only attains the dignity of knighthood, but also the royal crown. He becomes the legendary King Arthur.

II. Technical Information

The present version of King Arthur – Conquest of the Crown has been developed for Windows 10 or 11 with a 64-bit processor architecture.

Accordingly, the game will function correctly on all modern PCs using Windows as their operating system.

III. Installation

After unpacking the .zip file package, a file with the extension .cmd can be found in the root directory: startKingArthur.cmd.

Depending on the extraction process of the .zip package, the root directory may be visible at once or may be located inside another folder. Simply browse then through the existing folders. If you find the file startKingArthur.cmd, you are in the correct location.

By double-clicking the file startKingArthur.cmd, the start commands are executed and the program begins to run.

For greater convenience, it is recommended to create a desktop launcher.

You will find all informations about this, the installation process and the game itself in the .txt-files of the package: KING-ARTHUR-MANUAL-ENGLISH.txt and KING-ARTHUR-ANLEITUNG-DEUTSCH.txt.
